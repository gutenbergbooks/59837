                                PREFACE.


This volume is the second annual cumulation of the Book Review Digest.
In the main it includes the books of 1906 that have been commented upon
by the best critics. It aims, on the one hand, to record truthfully the
scope, character and subject content of books as they appear, and, on
the other, to supplement this descriptive information from month to
month with excerpts culled from the best current criticism appearing in
forty-five English and American magazines which make a prominent feature
of book reviews, thus furnishing to the librarian and bookseller a basis
for the evaluation of books.

Frequently the best reviews of a book appear during the year following
its publication, so in this volume will be found supplementary excerpts
relating to books which were entered in the 1905 annual.

It will also be observed that a number of entries include only the
descriptive note. These titles look to the year 1907 to furnish the
material for appraisal, and excerpts will be published in current
numbers of the Digest as fast as reviews appear.

During the first year of the Cumulative Book Review Digest’s existence
the question of its being entered as second class matter was pending. It
was finally ruled out on account of the cumulative idea. So the second
year a new name and a new plan which would meet the postal requirements
cut off the recognition of the first volume, and the Book Review Digest
was launched as volume one. Now that the post office ruling has been
reversed, the present volume may take its place chronologically as
volume two of our series.

The publications, named above, undoubtedly represent the leading reviews
of the English-speaking world. Few libraries are able to subscribe for
all and the smaller libraries are supplied with comparatively few of the
periodicals from which the digests are to be culled. For this reason the
digest will be of greater value to the small libraries, since it places
at their disposal, in most convenient form, a vast amount of valuable
information about books, which would not otherwise be available.

We shall endeavor to make the descriptive notes so comprehensive, and
the digests so full and accurate, that librarians who do not have access
to the reviews themselves, will be able to arrive at substantially
correct appreciations of the value of the books reviewed.

This is particularly true in regard to the English periodicals, which
are practically out of the reach of the ordinary library; we shall
endeavor to make the digest of these reviews so complete that there will
be little occasion to refer to the original publications.

=Abbott, G. F.= Through India with the prince. *$3.50. Longmans.

  As special correspondent for the Calcutta Statesman, Mr. Abbott
  accompanied the Prince and Princess of Wales on their recent tour
  thru’ India. The author gives the route of the royal party making the
  description interesting with receptions and fêtes; he records
  observations socially and politically; he “touches on every imaginable
  topic that India offers to a writer.” (Dial.) “Disposed to be
  epigrammatic, sarcastic, and ironical, in epigram he is sometimes
  betrayed into excess.” (Lond. Times.)

  “The style is, as the French say, ‘tortured,’ or, in other words,
  there is some straining after effect. We are, nevertheless, able to
  commend Mr. Abbott’s volume: and his photographs are among the best of
  the many good Indian photographs we have seen.”

  “The want of descriptive power and the too pronounced personal note

=Acton, Sir John Emerich Edward Dalberg-Acton, 1st baron.= Lord Acton
and his circle; ed. by Abbot [Francis Aidan] Gasquet. *$4.50. Longmans.

  The letters of Lord Acton render a direct service in throwing light on
  a personality little known and little understood. “With the exception
  of a few letters written to Mr. Wetherell, all those here published
  were addressed to Richard Simpson, one of the most brilliant though
  least famous of the Oxford converts to Rome, and they are all
  concerned with the conduct of ‘The rambler,’ ‘The home and foreign
  review,’ and the other periodicals which occupied the energetic youth
  of Acton.... We see in the letters how thoroughly Acton was imbued
  with the principle of growth in religious thought.... We get a series
  of interesting glances into European and Papal politics before either
  Bismarck had won his laurels or the Pope had lost his crown.” (Ath.)

                  *       *       *       *       *

  “It may be said of the letters as a whole that they will possess most
  importance to the liberal section of English Catholics, for whom,
  indeed, the book seems to have been written.”

    + + =Ath.= 1906, 2: 472. O. 20. 1510w.

  “On the whole the picture of Lord Acton as it appears in this volume
  is a very favorable one.”

    + + =Cath. World.= 84: 401. D. ’06. 1560w.

  “Attractively edited.”

    + + =N. Y. Times.= 11: 808. D. 1, ’06. 190w.

  “The letters contained in the present volume are of surpassing
  interest.”

    + + =Sat. R.= 102: sup. 3. O. 13, ’06. 1310w.

  “The editor has done his work of annotating the letters and explaining
  the allusions admirably; and it could not have been an easy task.”

    + + =Spec.= 97: 621. O. 27, ’06. 1200w.


=Adams, Andy.= Cattle brands. †$1.50. Houghton.

  Life on the frontier in the eighties is vividly portrayed in the
  fourteen stories which Mr. Adams, “a veteran cowboy,” has included in
  this volume. These are tales “of the desperado; of man-to-man
  difficulties; of queer characters; the adventures of the cowboy in the
  field of politics, the capture of outlaws by rangers; and the ransom
  of rich rancheros who have been kidnapped.” Some titles are: Drifting
  North, Bad Medicine, A winter round-up, A college vagabond, The double
  trail, Rangering, and The story of a poker steer.

                  *       *       *       *       *

  “These stories are somewhat slight in texture, more suited to the
  ephemeral needs of a magazine than a bound volume, but they have a
  ring of sincerity about them and an insight into essentials.”

      + =Acad.= 70: 577. Je. 16, ’06. 280w.

  “To many people they will seem more enjoyable than the longer stories
  by Mr. Adams. Their merit lies wholly in the obvious truth to life of
  the scenes.”

      + =Critic.= 48: 571. Je. ’06. 60w.

  “The new book will seem to most readers too much like an echo of ‘The
  log of a cowboy’ to allow of its producing the same effect of
  sincerity.”

=Adams, Frederick Upham.= Bottom of the well. †$1.50. Dillingham.

  The capture of a smuggling craft by a revenue cutter off the Jamaica
  coast brings into view the hero of Mr. Adams’ story, a lad of twelve,
  the charge of the smugglers. Once separated from them, he is adopted
  and educated by a titled Englishman. From England the scene shifts to
  New York where young Stanley Deane espouses the cause of some much
  abused strikers whose plans brew within the four walls of the “Well.”
  He is convicted of murder, but cleared of the charge when the supposed
  victim dramatically appears and reads a serious lecture to the
  supporters of a police system that “makes justice a market place for
  the employment of incompetence and the enriching of pettifoggers.”


=Adams, Samuel.= Writings of Samuel Adams; ed. by H. A. Cushing. *$5.
Putnam.

  “In one respect this volume is superior to the first. It indicates
  with care the reason for attributing newspaper letters and other
  papers to Adams. Little more if anything can be demanded. The notes
  are numerous and helpful.” A. C. McLaughlin.

=Adler, Elkan Nathan.= About Hebrew manuscripts. *$2.50. Oxford.

  Nine detached pieces compose this group: Some missing chapters of Ben
  Sira; An ancient bookseller’s catalogue; Professor Blau on the Bible
  as a book; A letter of Menasseh Ben Israel; Jewish literature and the
  diaspora; The humours of Hebrew mss.; The romance of Hebrew printing:

  provides very useful material for further study.”

=Agnus, Orme, pseud. (John C. Higginbotham).= Sarah Tuldon. [+]75c.
Little.

  A popular edition of a 1904 book. Sarah Tuldon, an English peasant
  girl, is the type of heroine which one expects to find in historical
  novels, but her spirit, energy, good commonsense and generosity are
  directed towards leavening sordid conditions among the laboring
  classes. She is self-reared from most unpromising surroundings, and
  thru never-wearying perseverance reaches a position of self-command
  and generalship in her community.

=Ainger, Alfred.= Lectures and essays. 2v. *$5. Macmillan.

  Canon Ainger, “of blessed memory, never forgot in the pulpit that he
  was a man of letters, or out of it that he was a clergyman.” In these
  volumes, he “ranges over a wide field, from Chaucer to Tennyson,
  giving five lectures and two essays to Shakespeare, and writing also
  of Swift, Cowper, Burns, Scott, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Charles Lamb,
  Dickens, of children’s books, of actors, modern plays, conversation,
  of wit, and of euphuism.” (Spec.)

                  *       *       *       *       *

  “The saving grace in Canon Ainger was his appreciation of perfect

  be reminded.”

      + =Critic.= 48: 284. Mr. ’06. 100w.

†$1.50. Dutton.

  Mr. Aldin’s “gay dog” is a bull terrier owned by an actress. And the
  creature is as veritable a bit of canine irresponsibility and
  pomposity as one could imagine. He indulges in the fun-loving,
  care-free pursuits of his mistress, gets into scrapes, and is finally
  sent into the country to recuperate. His dog-philosophy is this: “Some
  dogs are too readily imposed upon—not I.”

  homely bourgeoise without rank and connections,” yet able to draw
  about her kings and princes, dukes and maréchals, in short, the
  literary, artistic and social lights of all Europe. Aside from being
  simply a diversion, the book sets forth much economic and social
  history of the latter half of the eighteenth century.

  New York from 1777, when the state constitution was drawn up, to 1832
  and the formation of the Whig party. Volume 2, (1833–1861) takes up
  the story and carries it down thru the formation of the republican
  party in 1854, to the crippling of the Weed machine in 1861. The
  causes of fractional divisions during these years are carefully
  traced, and the subtle methods by which such men as George Clinton,
  Hamilton, Burr, De Witt Clinton, Van Buren, Seymour and Thurlow Weed
  achieved leadership and in succession ordered the political course of

  unexpectedly ... he was of a serious and energetic bent. Early called
  to share in the government, he was a member of several cabinets....
  For years he was an enthusiastic follower of Gladstone, but broke with
  him on the land question and Home rule; but their personal friendship
  remained unimpaired. Yet his chief distinction was as a controversial
  writer. He had considerable scientific attainments. From early life an
  eager naturalist ... and was practically skilled in geology. He read
  widely in science, too, and being, as he innocently observes,
  ‘inclined to question rather than to harbor doubt’ he ‘took most

  With a dramatic power which is moving in its forcefulness this Spanish

  of such realism that the reader feels thruout that it is the dread
  hand of fate and not the author who relentlessly orders the unhappy
  life of Naundorff, and forces him finally to give up voluntarily the
  recognition he has struggled a lifetime to gain. The story of his
  lovely daughter Amélie, whose happiness is sacrificed, gives to the
  book a deeper human interest.

  the Pacific, Mr. Louis Becke may be relied upon to reel off yarns of
  adventure to any extent.... The young hero is caught by a ‘southerly
  buster’ while sailing in Sydney harbour, and driven out between the
  towering ironbound Heads which guard the entrance to that famous
  haven, we settle down with confidence to the perusal of a string of
  adventures in which no break is likely to occur.... A [story] that

  A tale of Australia which “shows intimate acquaintance with Australian

  atmosphere of vitality, of invincible youth greedy of life and domain
  is fairly heroic. Three young men “run their race with extraordinary
  vigor and leave the reader breathless, as was the way of the early
  Australian novels of the bushranging days. Modern worship of athletics
  has resuscitated the old type of wild rider and bold lover, but he has

  expresses the burden of her distracted mind. She loses her fortune,

=Benson, Edward Frederic.= Paul. †$1.50. Lippincott.

  Paul Norris and Norah Ravenscroft who had played together since
  childhood find that they love each other after Norah marries Theodore
  Beckwith, a mean-spirited shrivelled up specimen of mankind. Paul
  becomes Beckwith’s private secretary and incidentally is compelled to
  be a modern type of court fool, tho sacrificing none of his dignity
  and courage in playing an entertainer’s rôle to amuse a pagan,
  sensuous nature. Paul’s hatred for the man tempts him to run him down
  with a motor car, he repents at the last moment but too late to avert
  the tragedy. The second part of the story shows Paul’s remorse which
  would drown itself in drink, his conversion, his marriage with Norah,
  and his final reparation to a “calm, un-angry, inevitable justice” by
  saving the child of Theodore and Norah from certain death.

  is the supreme end of legal, and, in fact, of all education intended

=Blanchard, Amy Ella.= Four Corners. †$1.50. Jacobs.

  The three Virginia acres on which the somewhat impoverished Corner
  family lived formed the center of the stage upon which the four little
  Corners, Nan, Mary Lee, and the twins, a cousin, an old mule named
  Pete, an angora cat, a mongrel dog, and a few delightful grownups, act
  out a little family drama. In it, sad little economies, sickness, and
  trouble bravely met, are contrasted with the joys of healthy girlhood
  with homely adventures, and happy little surprises. It is a story that
  will make careless little girls thankful for their blessings.

=Blanchard, Amy Ella.= Little Miss Mouse. †$1. Jacobs.

  Miss Hester Brackenbury in days of affluence adopts two little waifs,
  a small boy and a girl, and when a few months later, she becomes poor
  she refuses to give them up but moves into a cottage and supports them
  by making buttonholes. It is a pretty story for grown-ups as well as
  children, for in the background is an old love-story which throws a
  mellow light upon the children in the foreground, their joys, their
  contentions and their troubles. In the end, thru little Miss Mouse and
  an old receipt, Aunt Hester is restored to her old estate.

  this: the plant is a machine; its movements in response to external
  stimuli, though apparently various, are ultimately reducible to a
  fundamental unity of reaction.... By means of ingenious delicate
  instruments which exaggerate the slightest motion at any spot, he has
  long been able to demonstrate that even the oldest tissues of a plant,
  so long as they are living are capable of responding in a marked
  degree to certain external stimuli. A special feature distinguishing

  personality; to show that personality in touch with its human
  environment; to declare what manner of man was he whose name is on the
  title page. Not to chronicle events, therefore, but to describe a
  being; not to write a history of the time, but to give an impression
  of a period associated with its dominant personal force, has been my
  task.” Thus the work is an intimate personal sketch of the man, based
  upon years of study.

  and later exhibit nuclei and then divide. It is held that they are not

  A book which embodies the spirit of Christian science without the

  lifted up ... will draw all men unto me.” A king of finance just ready
  to “shuffle off this mortal coil” by act of suicide withdraws to the
  slum section of London to hide his deed in a pauper’s seclusion. Here
  he is found by a “little rat of the gutter,” an ugly girl of twelve
  years, with astonishing insight into human hearts. This child with her
  sure faith in God as a present unfeared reality; Jenny Montaubyn who
  had taught her this hope; Polly, a girl of the streets; and a hungry
  thief form a group who make a great capitalist take hope and desire to

  the way of advertising-finesse. He seizes the moment to launch a ware
  upon a gullible public, and whether it be porous plasters or guinea
  pigs his success is obvious.

  Silvia Landis, a spoiled society girl, and Stephen Siward, who has
  inherited a weakness for drink, meet at a railway station “and
  continue the game there begun at a house party where assorted time
  killers are assembled.... Silvia angles for a new millionaire and
  plays with Stephen even while she lands him.... The story passes from
  the house party to the city, where Silvia pursues her social pastimes
  and retains her golden fiancé and Stephen ... fights the demon rum
  alone with more or less unsuccess. You have in the meantime club
  scenes, bridge scenes, scenes of domestic, infelicity, scenes of
  sordid life, glimpses of the half-world, a panorama of high
  finance.... In the end ... Mr. Chambers, to achieve his happy ending
  appropriates a motor car ... and lets it blow up with the marplot.”

=Churchill, Winston.= Coniston. †$1.50. Macmillan.

  Love and politics are deftly blended in this life story of Jethro
  Bass, the New England politician of a generation ago, the crude man of
  the tannery who made himself a power in the state. His first victory,
  won by questionable methods, cost him the first Cynthy, but after a
  life in which his politics outweighed his love, great as that love
  was, he at last retires from the political field in a voluntary
  sacrifice of his power to the second Cynthia’s happiness. The book is
  full of strong characters; Bob, Cynthia’s lover, Bob’s father, old
  Ephraim, Ezra Graves. All Coniston seems to live upon its pages, with
  its local interests, its plots and counter plots; but the warm heart
  and the shrewd unscrupulous mind of Jethro, and the noble spirited
  girl who loved him while she despised his methods are the truly great
  things of the book.

=Churchill, Winston.= Title-mart. **75c. Macmillan.

  In this little three-act comedy Mr. Churchill satirizes the American
  custom of bartering off comely heiresses in the title-market. The
  scene is laid in a millionaire’s New England “camp,” the principal
  actors are a practical father, an ambitious stepmother, an athletic
  daughter devoted to jiu-jitsu, and an English lord who for the
  amusement of the moment trades his title for the plain Reginald
  Burking, M. P. of the friend accompanying him. The situations growing
  out of the exchange of identity are humorously farcical.

  The fact that Mr. Winston Churchill is not of the party in the
  interests of which his father ran his brief political career insures
  for this work non-partisan treatment. It deals with Lord Churchill’s
  public rather than his private life, and is in the main a record of
  ten brief years of an effective career. During this period Lord
  Churchill became leader of the House of Commons and chief exponent of
  the so-called Tory democracy, attempted the reform of the Conservative
  party from within and in the end broke with all his former leaders and
  colleagues. “The atmosphere is from start to finish severely

=Comstock, Harriet T.= Meg and the others. 75c. Crowell.

  Two little girls of to-day, sitting in the firelight just before
  bed-time hear the stories of Meg, and Mary, and the Boy, which their
  grandmother calls out of the long ago for them. And when they have
  heard all about them, their games, their troubles, and their
  adventures, when they have learned to love them, and are loath to let
  them go, they find that Mary is a nice old lady who is coming to live
  with them, and that Meg and the Boy are really their own dear
  grandmother and grandfather.

  is love, and she would demonstrate the fact that riches menace its
  possession. David Helmsley, an aged multi-millionaire, becomes a tramp
  in pursuit of definite happiness, he gives and takes in his wanderings
  and learns both are spontaneous. Finally he is nursed back from death
  by one who teaches him the great love lesson which, without any
  matrimonial thought, blesses his closing days.

  Desire, a musician by instinct, by training, and by heredity, spends a
  summer in British Columbia among the Indians, canoeing, sailing,
  mountain-climbing and fishing. Here she discovers in a young Alaska
  Indian, adopted and educated by white people, a soul fired by ambition
  and pride, one that reflects the sad poetry of vanishing traditions.
  The love idyll is interwoven with flagrant race prejudice, political
  scenes, and true-to-life sketches of Indian character.

=Daniel, James Walter.= Maid of the foothills; or, Missing links in the

  It has been the aim of the author to depict the spirit of the times
  truthfully, and to give proper place to the importance of the
  Red-shirt movement which severed the shackles of a bound populace. The
  story treats of the grim humor of the oppressed citizens, the heroism
  of Southern women in that period of severest trial and oppression, and
  shows the infamous deeds and evil spirit of Southern men who joined
  the hosts of carpet-baggers and helped them to bleed the prostrate
  state.

  Jim Jackson who tells the tale of his crime the night before the

  victims of negative circumstances. Not with the spirit of resentment
  but of discouragement over never having had a chance in life, Jim
  tells his story with a mildness that “is a more severe arraignment of
  social conditions than the fiercest tirades could be.” (Bookm.)

  Helena Richie’s soul awakening seems so natural and possible amid the
  Old Chester people and Old Chester surroundings, with Dr. Lavendar at
  his best, as philanthropist, philosopher and mentor. This woman has
  violated the structural facts of the moral law. She is led by little
  David, a homeless child whom she takes, to discover the great religion
  of duty. As the light comes, her old standards seem the poor tottering
  things they really are and she struggles for permanent defences. When
  her life becomes known and Dr. Lavendar regards her unfit to keep
  David, her submission to the law of retributive justice which operates
  for a time then gives way, and her determination to make the remainder
  of her life “clear and sound” but give evidence to the genuineness of
  her awakened sincerity.

  power of enjoying life. The social and literary man, with a warm
  interest in politics, was a “good husband and father; he was honest
  (though his sincerity was sometimes under suspicion from the rapidity
  of his conclusions); he was kind; but he always got through more than
  he earned, and the result is a record of perpetual struggle to meet
  the claims upon him.... His extravagance led to a growing discontent,

=Dudden, F. Holmes.= Gregory the Great: his place in history and

  detailed history of the life of Pope Gregory the Great; (2) a
  systematic exposition of Gregory’s theological opinions; (3) an
  account of the political, social and religious characterization of the
  Gregorian age. “Mr. Dudden has fairly faced his difficult task, and
  his industry has been equal to his courage. The book rests upon a
  thorough analysis of the original sources to which, by the way, an
  admirable index serves as guide, whether one use the narrative or not.

  all reference to the work of other scholars. In the more general field
  of thought and theology of the age Mr. Dudden fails, if at all, in
  completeness. He does not take a wide enough sweep. Gregory’s mental
  peculiarities are treated too much as isolated phenomena. It seems

  “Tempest Ladon, is a north-country squire of ancient lineage, who
  marries a young Italian lady. Elena dies in giving birth prematurely
  to a son, and leaves behind her a casket of love-letters written, she
  says, to her husband, which he promises never to read. The son, St.
  John, in his turn, marries a beautiful middle-class girl and brings
  her home to his father, who hates her as she hates him. Meanwhile
  Tempest discovers that he is dying of sarcoma, and is so afraid of
  hell-fire if he commits suicide that he tries to persuade his son to
  take the chances of damnation and kill him. Ultimately the
  daughter-in-law is tempted into handing him the overdose which ends
  him, but not before he has discovered that Elena’s letters were
  written to an Italian cousin, who is the real father of St.
  John.”—Acad.

=Fenollosa, Mary McNeil (Mrs. Ernest F. Fenollosa) (Sidney McCall,

  The depth of feeling which the Japanese of the passing generation hold
  for Japan and the art that has always been hers is strongly brought
  out in this story of Kano Indara, the last of a line of great artists,
  who views with terror the encroachments of western art. He hears of
  Tatsu, the wild mountain dragon painter and, in his deathless longing
  for an artist-son, he sends for him and gives to him his daughter
  Umè-Ko that he may be indeed his son, and also because he could not
  hold him otherwise, for the youth has painted his dragon-pictures
  merely because his soul was filled with a longing for the dragon-maid,
  his mate thruout all incarnations. When he finds her in Kano’s
  daughter his great love absorbs the artist in him and Kano, who lives
  for art alone, in his rage and disappointment takes the young wife
  from her too-loving husband until, from the depths of his great grief
  and agony of spirit, the artist in him once more emerges, then she is
  restored to him as from the dead.

  state of her mind and incidentally betrays the fact that she had not
  made the way all sunshine for her husband. Grown cynical and harsh,

  hereditary monarchs since 1050 B. C. and whose civilization is what

  to murder her, and follows her in behalf of his old paper, to Yaque
  where she is offered her father’s throne and a royal husband. All

  somewhat pessimistic chapter describes the physical, mental and moral
  deterioration of the masses. Mr. George devotes a chapter to the

  privilege, chiefly the use of the courts, and corruption in politics.
  The proposed remedy of all these inequalities and wrongs, as one would
  naturally infer from Mr. George’s well-known predilections, is to be

  impersonally conventional. “The three women represent as many types;
  Gerty a mondaine of the better sort ... holding her silken skirts
  above the soil of scandal, and underneath a mocking mask, keeping a
  pinioned soul; Connie Adams, a silly moth, fluttering in endless
  gayeties outside the more exclusive circles ... and the cloisteral
  Laura, not only a genius, but a consummate flower of womanhood. Of the
  men, Perry Bridewell and Arnold Kemper are not unlike—pleasure-seeking
  men of the clubs.... Bridewell is not much more than a well-groomed,
  handsome body; Kemper is Bridewell with intellect added. Adams, on the
  contrary, is the absorbed man of letters ... caring for no pleasure

  position to become a common workingman, and eventually embarks in a
  socialistic venture having for its object the establishment of a
  Utopian commonwealth in Africa. These are not his only sacrifices, for
  love also is cast aside, and it is not until the end of much suffering
  that his early passion is replaced by one fixed upon far surer
  foundations. The characterization is excellent, alike of the two
  women, the devoted hero, and his masterful father, whose money seems
  to the son too tainted for legitimate enjoyment.”—Dial.

Gray mist, a novel; by the author of “The martyrdom of an empress.”
**$1.50. Harper.

  The fleecy grayness of a Breton mist permeates this story of Pierrek,
  the child who is sent by the sea to the empty arms of a woman whose
  wits are wandering because of the loss of her own baby boy. With true
  Breton faith in the miraculous he is considered hers, grows to manhood
  on the Breton cliffs, marries the girl of his choice, becomes a loving
  husband, and a happy father, only to learn thru a woman’s jealousy
  that his mother of mothers is not his own and that his wife is his own
  sister. Then indeed the grey mist envelops him and he goes back to the
  gray sea leaving those he loves in sorrow and facing a hopeless future
  which the impenetrable mists of life and death envelope like a shroud.

Page.

  This story which records a series of adventures that begin in a
  sleeping-car between Calais and Basle, and come to an end on the north
  African shore as sprightly as one could wish. Briefly told, Lord
  Blackadder divorces his wife. She wishes to escape with her child whom
  the father also cares to possess. In order to facilitate her flight by
  confusing the confidential agents who might follow her, she and her
  twin sister gowned alike, and accompanied by maids closely resembling
  one another journey in different directions, the one with the child
  and the other with a dummy. The flight and the pursuit give rise to
  numerous exciting situations.

  How Charles Bosanquet, minister of industrial affairs, framed a
  measure which settled for a time the problem of the great army of the
  unemployable in London, and what came of it, is the burden of this
  story. First the starving masses are drawn, hideous, menacing,
  parasites upon the working poor; then comes the minister’s solution;
  those whom the courts deem unfit for society are to be made slaves for
  life. This is the beginning of that awful thing, the slave colony in
  the Cornish hinterland at which the Christian world stood aghast. Thru
  all this a love story is developed. Bosanquet and his old friend, John
  Hazel, now his political opponent, both love Muriel, an active worker
  in the anti-slavery league. And then the day comes when the slaves

  A tale of thrilling sea-adventure thru which runs the romance of the

  a part of the boat’s company, breathes the salt air, enjoys the rough,
  out-spoken ways of the captain, delights in the Irish grit of Larry
  O’Toole and enters into the thick of the fight with the convict
  pirates. There is swift action in the narrative, and many a strong

=Haldane, Elizabeth S.= Descartes: his life and times. $4.50. Dutton.

  “Miss Haldane has hit upon a fortunate analysis of the life of
  Descartes, and its distribution under three general heads: His
  education, from 1596 to 1612; his ‘Wanderjahre,’ from 1612 to 1628,
  spent in seeing the world, in travel and warfare, and, finally, what
  may be called his constructive period, ‘after his warfare was over,
  and this dates from 1628 to 1650.’... In tracing his experience in
  each of the periods Miss Haldane gives much and very intelligent
  attention to the environment, historical and personal, in which it was
  passed; and this has the merit not only of bringing out more
  distinctly the true picture of Descartes, but of rendering the general
  reader, for whom obviously the work is done, more at home with the

  “The story has many appealing qualities,—its gayety, sympathy, humour,
  and lifelikeness; and perhaps to American readers one of its chiefest
  charms will be that it is so thoroughly English,—as English as a
  hedge-rose or a bit of pink hawthorne,—yet, with all its local colour,
  sounding the human and universal note.” Kate Douglas Wiggin.

=Hart, Albert Bushnell=, ed. American nation: a history from original
sources by associated scholars. 28v. per. v. *$2. Harper.

  Group II of this series of histories, volumes 6–10, is devoted to the
  “Transformation into a nation,” including Provincial America, by
  Evarts Boutell Greene; France in America, by Reuben Gold Thwaites;
  Preliminaries of the Revolution, by George Elliott Howard; The
  American Revolution, by Claude Halstead Van Tyne; and The
  confederation and the constitution, by Andrew Cunningham McLaughlin.
  The first volume of Group III, which division includes volumes 11–15
  and treats the “Development of the nation,” is a discussion of The
  federalist system, by John Spencer Bassett. The author says, “On its
  political side this volume treats of three principal facts; the
  successful establishment of the government under the constitution, the
  organization of the Republican party on the basis of popular
  government, and the steady adherence of the government to a policy of
  neutrality at a time when we were threatened with serious foreign
  complications.” The author follows the program of establishing an
  effective government while the nation faced a new constitution and
  trying international situations.

  Number twelve in this “American nation” series is a discussion of “The
  Jeffersonian system” by Edward Channing. It “emphasizes the innate
  tendency to expansion of territory, of which Louisiana, West Florida,
  and Oregon were all examples. The special and successful purpose of
  the author is to make clear how it was possible for the nation to
  expand in territory and in spirit, and for the federal government to
  gain consequence and authority, while at the same time the government
  was growing more democratic: it is a study in imperial democracy.”

  Number fourteen in this series is the “Rise of the new West” by
  Frederick Jackson Turner of the University of Wisconsin. “Professor
  Turner takes up the west as an integral part of the Union, with a
  self-consciousness as lively as that of the east or south, with its
  own aims and prejudices, but as a partner in the councils and the
  benefits of the national government which, as a whole, it is the aim
  at this volume to describe.” The period covered is that from 1815 to
  1830. The panic of 1819, the Missouri compromise, The Monroe doctrine
  in particular and the tariff disputes, internal improvements and
  foreign trade relations in general are fully treated.

  The fifteenth volume of “The American nation” series is Dr. William
  McDonald’s discussion of “Jacksonian democracy.” The aggressive
  personality of Andrew Jackson is made to dominate the solution of the
  great questions of national policy paramount during the years 1829–37.
  The study reveals the president and man, and shows the evolution of
  the political principles upon which a new democratic party was
  founded.

  In volume seventeen the expansion movement which extended the
  boundaries of the United States from the western edge of the Louisiana
  purchase to the Pacific ocean, is described “in such a way as to
  indicate the real forces which gave it impulse, and how they actually
  worked, and especially to show how it was affected by, and how it
  reacted upon, the contemporaneous sectionalizing movement which
  finally ended in civil war.”

  In volume 18 of “The American nation” Dr. Smith has covered the
  subject of “Parties and slavery from 1850 to 1859,” that transition
  period, which saw old party organization dissolve and new ones
  crystalize. The aim of the volume is “to bring out the contrast
  between the old parties and their aims and the new and imperious
  issues.” The efforts to prevent the crisis which resulted in the Civil
  war, and the rival habits of thought which made it inevitable are
  clearly shown, the effects of the struggle upon parties, legislation
  and the courts as well as the social and economic changes brought
  about by railroad development and the growth of cotton are carefully
  detailed.

  “The first part of volume nineteen in the “American nation” series
  discusses political divergences in the light of sectional rivalry and
  mutual dislike revealed by the election of Lincoln to the presidency.

=Hawkes, Clarence.= Shaggycoat; the biography of a beaver; il. by
Charles Copeland. **$1.25. Jacobs.

  Shaggycoat easily wins and holds every nature student’s attention. He
  is a member of a fast vanishing animal family, but sturdily upholds
  the traditions of his four-footed antecedents. The book reveals the
  habits, haunts and occupations of the beaver, shows how his nomadic
  habit leads him close to his enemies at times, and gives now and then
  a bit of primitive superstition which even greedy trappers heed.

  Matthieu de Châtelfors and Huette de Richecour are betrothed at birth.
  Huette develops into a plain, passionate, rather shrewish young woman
  whom Matthieu delays marrying on one pretext and another. She is too
  proud to insist and time drags on. With a promise to marry her on his
  return, he leaves for the battle-field. There follows a romantic
  meeting with a pretty peasant girl whose refusal of Matthieu’s love
  arouses his determination to wed her. The curtain rings down on the

  “Wilhelmine von Gravenitz was one of the most fascinating women of the
  eighteenth century. More passionate, and vastly more intelligent than
  La Pompadour, her French rival in intrigue and gallantry, she was a
  nobler type of woman, for she was really in love with Eberhard Ludwig,
  the reigning Duke of Wirtemburg, and though she played his dull and
  colorless wife many a cruel trick, and even attempted to assassinate
  her, our sympathies in spite of ourselves are stirred rather in the
  favour of the brilliant mistress than of the highly respectable but
  phlegmatic wife. To depict the life of a woman of this class in a

  indulge it to such an extent that the reader does not know when he is
  reading history and when he is reading fiction. The ordinary reader
  will question whether the record of Wilhelmine might not give off a
  more pungent odour to other nostrils; and still more will he doubt

  royal heart, facing her enemies in the field of battle, meeting
  diplomatists in the council chamber, and discharging with grace and
  gaiety the duties of hostess, or the functions of a queen, and Mr.
  Henderson can make allowances for the strong temptations which led to
  her fall. But in her long and cruel confinement he loses touch with
  her. Without adequate conception of her rights, or of the part which
  as a queen and a Catholic she should have played, he considers her now
  as an actress, a devote, a mischief-maker. But her conduct at her
  trial and execution again appeals to him and he concludes with a

  a foolish drinking bout changes the course of true love. Dorothea

  “The first English version of a curious English drama, written about
  1469, and made from the editor’s manuscript copy of the only extant
  exemplar of the Lyons edition, printed about 1486. There is also but
  one copy known of an edition of about 1489, and the present version is
  illustrated with fac-similes of the quaint woodcuts in that edition.
  No earlier samples of these old farces have come down to our day. This
  play was wonderfully popular, and attained a fame unparallelled in the
  history of the early stage and seldom equalled since. All students of
  the drama will be interested in it.”—Critic.

  translation is, like the original, idiomatic and rollicking. Its
  author catches the lights and shades; he sees and renders all the
  humour. He is, at times, it is true a little stilted.”

=Holbrooke, George O.= Verses. $1. Broadway pub.

  The humanitarian note is strong in these poems, which give to life at
  its worst hope, altho there is a touch of fatalism, and give to the
  reader picturesque visions of the New York poor. There are also verses
  which tell of a pretty deed done by Lafayette; of the dazed return of
  Knickerbocker to his old haunts; and there are songs of other times
  and other places.

  “A spirited account of the hunt for hare, wolf, lynx, and fox in the
  foothills of the Sierra Madre, and of the deer, bighorn, and mountain
  lion amid the crags and precipices of the Southern Sierras.... A
  number of pages are devoted to the varied sport which the angler finds
  with tuna, black sea-bass, and yellowtail, with deep-sea trolling and
  still-angling off the shores of Southern California and its adjacent
  islands, and with the trout of the clear mountain streams of the Coast

  forms, the laws that govern its orderly development and its logical
  relation to other great departments of human thought, its specifically

  “A number of letters which passed from ‘Daddy’ Crisp, the friend of
  Fanny Burney, to his sister, Mrs. Gast, who lived in Burford in the
  house now occupied by Hutton himself. The letters contain nothing very
  striking and add but little to our own sum of knowledge of Fanny
  Burney, Johnson, Mrs. Thrale or other famous people of the day.... But
  they were well worth preserving for the charm of their kindliness and
  humour, and the picture of the life of the times which they
  exhibit.... For the rest, Mr. Hutton’s essays are very largely
  concerned with the literary history of the Cotswolds and the
  neighborhood—small beer most of it, but refreshing and pleasant. He
  writes of Shenstone, of Richard Jago ... and other minor poets; and
  winds up with an able study of George Crabbe, a poet whom he

  It is totally free from theological bias: it is eminently fair-minded

  A closer examination, however, reveals a wide discrepancy in
  knowledge, treatment, and expression between the first part of the
  book and the second. A number of minor errors and inaccuracies reveal
  his inadequate acquaintance with the recent literature of this period

  a Lutheran empire, the effects in Germany of the religious wars in
  France and the Netherlands, the war against the Turks, the
  establishment and progress of the Jesuits in Germany and the final
  sessions and general effect of the Council of Trent. Volumes nine and

  proclamation of the famous Formula of Concord, to the beginning of the
  Thirty years’ war—a period that included the Cologne catastrophe, the
  introduction of the Gregorian calendar, the rise and fall of the

  Of his work the author says: “While it is intended to be a complete
  exposition of the science of money ... its unique characteristics, if
  it possess any will be found in the deep practical significance it
  discovers in the phenomena of price, in its analysis of the demand for
  money, in its exposition of credit as related to prices and the rate
  of interest, and in the clearness it gives to the concepts of
  commodity money, fiat money, and credit money. This book deals with
  money as an independent economic entity, and seeks to bring out the
  fact that ‘price’ in the world of business is a more important word
  than ‘value’.”

=Johnson, Owen, Max Fargus.= †$1.50. Baker.

  A most unpleasing group of people are met with in the course of this
  story, which is interesting because the characters are well drawn, and
  the plot is well handled. Max Fargus, an old miser, rich thru the
  astute management of his oyster houses, meets in the park an
  impoverished actress who shrewdly leads him on and, posing as a
  country girl, actually wins his affections. He has her investigated,
  however, by a shyster lawyer before he marries her and the lawyer
  drives a crafty bargain with the girl, by which, in return for his
  favorable report, he is to receive half her gains. After marriage
  Fargus becomes suspicious and later works out a revenge which succeeds
  so well that all the leading characters are left either dead or
  miserable and the shyster’s partner, who has become his enemy,
  receives the Fargus money.

  premise of a particular syllogism without begging the question. His
  chapter entitled ‘The presuppositions of inductive reasoning: the law
  of causation’ is a model of clear and forcible reasoning. Mill’s four

  in New Zealand. “Written chiefly during the years 1840–1846, they
  cover a period of Browning’s life of which little has been made
  public—the period just preceding his marriage, while he was living at
  New Cross, writing and publishing serially his ‘Bells and
  pomegranates.’... This collection of letters, though small, revealing
  a masculine friendship surviving the strain of separation of years,
  and of divided interests, helps to make an impression of a character
  which becomes the more exalted as it is better known. Portraits of
  Browning, of Domett, and of Sir Joseph Arnould (a third in this trio

=Lawrence, Albert Lathrop.= Wolverine. 75c. Little.

  A new popular edition of “The Wolverine.” The scene of this romance is
  laid in Michigan territory just before it becomes the Wolverine state.
  Perry North, a young man of New England blood, and pale orange colored
  hair, comes to Detroit from his home state, Massachusetts, as a
  government surveyor. He meets Marie Beaucoeur, and loves her in spite
  of the fact that her free French Catholic views of life are a constant
  shock to his Puritanical upbringing. It is only after many thrilling
  scenes such as naturally belong to that time and place where the Ohio
  boundary line was a constant source of trouble, and negroes and
  Indians added an unruly element, that young North comes to reconcile
  his conscience and his love.

=Linville, Henry R., and Kelly, Henry A.= Text-book in general zoology.

  A text-book for the educational public with suggestions for laboratory
  work. The volume is intended for high-school or elementary college
  classes and the inductive method is used with each class and phylum of
  invertebrate animals. In the first chapter after the remainder of the
  Arthropoda are described the other invertebrate phyla follow in a
  descending series, ending with Protozoa. Then, beginning with the
  fishes, the order ascends to the mammals and closes with man. There
  are 233 illustrations.

  with the quicker blood of his non-religious father flowing fast in his
  veins, tries hard to make of himself a minister, and failing, finds in
  his father’s iron business a broad field of action. But he grounds his
  life upon those early material teachings and becomes thru struggle and
  temptation a true hero worthy of Ardea’s love, a conqueror of
  circumstance and of himself. The characters of the fiery old Major to
  whom the north is still the enemy’s country, of young Farley, who is
  almost too conventional a villain, and of the mountaineers and
  ironworkers who play a large part in the story are strongly drawn.

  The healing of mind and body is dealt with in this novel in which
  nearly every character stands for some variety of scientific or
  religious opinion. Chief among them are “Professor Baron Lisse, of
  Leyden, the great bacteriologist in religion a conforming Protestant
  skeptic; his wife, a poet, converted, in the course of the story, to
  Roman Catholicism; their son Edward, who from childhood has hated his
  father’s vivisection, and who wins fame as a follower of Charcot; Sir
  James Graye, an idiot on whose skull Edward operates, enabling him to
  regain sufficient reason to learn the wickedness of the world and
  escape from it by suicide ... Kenneth Graye, James’s devoted uncle and
  guardian, who—so far as we understand mental ailments—went mad because
  he believed madness to be hereditary in his family, and recovered his
  sanity, partly on receiving proof that it was not, completely on
  receiving proof that he had misjudged a tragic event in his own life.”

  life for Greece, and Countess Riga rather than fall into the hands of

  Thyrza’s death, and later Byron’s passing away at Messolonghi bring

  brilliant young statesman on the eve of a great future, of the use of
  his limbs. It is reported that he is dead and he does not deny this
  report. A young Englishman, Herriard, nurses him, brings him back to
  London secretly, and becomes the mouthpiece of Gastineau, who directs
  his friend’s course each day from his couch and thus wins political
  prominence for Herriard. At this point an old murder mystery is
  revived. Herriard is retained as lawyer for the accused countess with
  whom he falls in love, and when it develops that she was the woman
  whom Gastineau once loved and pursued with his attentions, when it is
  proven that Gastineau was the real murderer, and when Gastineau is
  suddenly cured by a great specialist, and his friendship for Herriard
  becomes enmity, we have complications enough.

  clergyman who had been a cow-puncher and gambler, but now “deep in
  schemes for converting the backcountry farming folk into a decent
  church-going set,” and Bob Travers who was hunting the world over for
  the wonderful eyes and voice belonging to a girl whom he had twice
  rescued from danger. And the tide of love only begins when she marries
  the author Conningsby. It is once again the story of mis-mating, with
  more of a plot than the average latter-day novel possesses.

  “Peter and Alexis” is the last of Merejkowski’s trilogy, “The Christ
  and the anti-Christ,” the other two being “The death of the Gods,” and
  “The forerunner.” It deals with a purely Russian theme. “While it
  incidentally exhibits Russia and all classes and conditions of
  Russians at the beginning of the eighteenth century, it centres around
  one of the most piteous examples to be found in all history of what is
  ever a moving and a piteous theme—the gradual alienation of son from
  father, and father from son.... On the one side looms Peter the Great,
  the master-worker, building Russia with his own hands; half man, half
  were-wolf.... On the other side is Alexis, the weakling, the victim of
  fate, naturally affectionate, but utterly inadequate.” The volume
  closes with a description of his journey back to Russia and the

  An old estate which has brought grief to the hero’s father and which
  has been inherited by the heroine without his knowledge, complicates
  their love affairs for three acts, and while the heroine is, unknown
  to her, pressing the hero for money on an old debt in order that she

=Merriam, George Spring.= Negro and the nation; A history of American

  Strong pro-negro feeling is shown thruout this volume, which beginning
  with the growth of slavery in America, traces the history of the black
  race in our country down to the present day. All the events in our
  national life which had to do with slavery are carefully considered,
  while chapters are devoted to the leading men both white and black
  whose influence has helped to mold the black man’s destiny. It is a
  comprehensive study, written in an interesting style and leading
  logically up to the conclusion that the solution of the race problem
  lies in dealing with each man according to his merits, regardless of
  color, and leaving the ultimate relation of the races to nature and
  the sovereign powers.

  ‘Anthony Overman.’ The hero is a renascent Daniel Deronda, with a
  modern as well as a racial difference; the heroine a ‘yellow woman
  journalist.’ Such elements must needs strike fire when they meet,
  and the story deals with their interaction and final ...

  emotional, unscrupulous little girl-reporter, listening at doors,
  lying, cheating, keen as a rat terrier, looks upon life as war. She
  bows to a code of strictly professional ethics, but it sanctions
  behavior of which you cannot approve.” (Atlan.) “Her quest for ‘copy’
  brings her into intimate relations with public and private scandals,
  family quarrels, divorce cases, and murders. The unscrupulous methods
  which she pursues in the attempt to score a ‘beat’ for her paper are
  hardly less repellent than the details of the cases themselves.”
  (Outlook.) In the end she “gives it all up to marry the reporter that
  she had always secretly admired, although professionally they were at
  swords’ points.” (Dial.)

  deadliest sin that a woman can commit in Ireland; he finds when she
  has gone that her personality has stamped itself upon his heart

  development of his nature through love of her, and the learning of the
  lesson that if he is to find the true life that exists somewhere for
  each of us, he must strip himself of his priestly office and find his
  soul in the world of men.... Finally ... it becomes inevitable that in
  order to leave his parish without scandal and hurt to the simple souls
  dwelling there, he should swim across the lake and allow it to be
  supposed that he is drowned.... In the moon light of a warm September
  night he leaves his priestly clothes and his priestly office upon one

  the close of the war, is described in grim detail in this story of the
  Acme cotton mills. Richard Travis, the man at their head, is a low

  persuade the poverty-stricken whites of the neighborhood to sell their
  little children into real slavery for a term of years at five cents a
  working hour. The book is a strong and terrible arraignment of child
  labor and in the end through the influence of the “Bishop” of
  Cottontown, the woman whom Travis really loved and lost, and other
  better souls, the mills become co-operative and the little children

  what he has been able to draw of the Martian details, with a

  has made an imaginary sketch of how the world would look from Mars.

  which has stuck to him since. As such he heads a long line of those
  whom the false representatives of Christianity have scandalized into
  rejection of the faith presented to them so deformed and smirched....
  He is not, however, hindered by his admiration for the austere
  idealist who is his hero from seeing his faults and fallacies, and

  large-minded and statesmanlike High Churchman among ourselves.’ The
  first volume extends to the death of Pius VII. in 1823, the second to
  the death of Pius IX. in 1878. A third volume, soon to follow, covers
  the pontificate of Leo XIII. The historian goes back to the beginning
  of the eighteenth century, when the first fight for ‘the Pope’s
  infallibility, which was the pith and marrow of the whole contention,’
  was won by the Jesuits against the Gallican Jansenists. The subsequent
  history, which he relates down to the adoption of that dogma by the
  Vatican council in 1870, might be summarized as the ‘Modern
  development of ultramontanism into papal autocracy.’”—Outlook.

  The practical, everyday world seems a very sordid thing to one who
  follows the story of this dreamer of dreams, who from nursery
  make-believes and childish day dreams passes into a youth of ideals
  and is left in his early manhood still a visionary but with many
  dreams come true. With a skilful touch Don is put before us;
  misunderstood by a commonplace father, an acknowledged failure at a
  practical college course, a failure in New York where he tries to make
  a living as a super at a second class theatre or at anything else, he
  suddenly blossoms into a recognized genius as a writer of plays. And
  through years of struggle, from earliest childhood, his love for
  Margaret, his ideal, burns like a white flame, and in return she loves
  him, marries him and makes him happy, altho like the rest of the
  world, she may not always understand him.

  Martin Coe, gunner’s mate, deserts from the American navy to lead a
  revolution in a South American state. By a strange chance he comes at
  length to a little Maine village where his regeneration begins. It is
  love that clarifies his nature, and brings to the surface the broken
  oath, neglected duty, general culpableness. His honor demands
  atonement, and his obedience to the call sends him back to the navy to
  serve out his term.

  after bringing repeated terror to England shot over the edge of a

  a poet receiving less than insular recognition.” The selections
  include ballads, blank verse and sonnets, “they are exquisitely
  graceful, and yet profoundly impressive, pervaded by a moving
  undertone of sadness, which perhaps reaches its full expression in the
  beautiful poem ‘The grave of my songs.’ How the poet could have
  remained in comparative obscurity so long can only be explained by the
  pre-eminence of his translations, and his own exceeding modesty as to
  his original writings.” (Outlook.)

  vivacious style.... The secrets of the trade of the man of science
  have never before been exposed so frankly. He shows how the progress
  of science has been at times impeded by too much knowledge.... A false
  hypothesis is often of more service than a true one, because it leads

  and the stringency of his logic leaves us without answer. Even in
  cases where our instincts rebel, we are carried away by the
  fascination of the language, which in each subdivision of the subject
  takes us with dramatic power to its artistic dénouement. The English
  translation errs, perhaps, on the side of following too literally

  handicapped by the lack of a general logical theory upon which to base
  his special logical investigations. Our author has no general theory
  of knowledge; and he passes by the most obvious epistemological
  considerations without so much as a nod of recognition. I fear that
  the reader has been given but a slight notion of the exceeding
  interest and suggestiveness of this work. If there is much that should
  awaken caution, there is also a fund of wise and penetrating
  observations. Those who are least attracted by the author’s

  Sarah Marsh, dubbed Aunt Sarah by her friends, is a typical example of
  an undemonstrative, stoical, but, withal, motherly New England woman
  of the Civil war times. She has two sons. Francis, the younger, leaves
  home to study. While away he discovers that his pledge of love to Hope
  Hamilton was a mistake. Hope, with true heroism, releases the student,
  to the relief of Philip, the elder son, a serious-minded manly young
  fellow who silently cherished a love for Hope. When the war summons
  comes the mother bravely speeds her sons on their way to the front,
  both of whom return; one to die, the other to find his happiness.

Readers’ Guide to periodical literature, 1900–1904, cumulated; ed. by
Anna Lorraine Guthrie. $16. Wilson, H. W.

  The cumulative system of indexes, which resulted from the
  consolidation of the Cumulative index to a selected list of
  periodicals and the Readers’ guide to periodical literature begins
  with this volume a series of five year indexes. It is a 1640 page
  volume indexing sixty-seven magazines. Since an index to periodicals
  is used primarily to find out what the magazines contain on a
  particular subject and is less frequently consulted for questions of
  authorship and title, this index is first of all a subject index. An
  author entry is given to each article, and title entries have also
  been given in the case of fiction, unusually distinctive titles, and
  sometimes poetry. Book reviews are indexed under the name of the
  author of the book and are usually given a subject entry also.

=Redesdale of Redesdale, Algernon Bertram Freeman-Mitford, 1st baron.=
Garter mission to Japan. $1.75. Macmillan.

  In passing from the Old Japan which filled the author’s “Tales” fifty
  years ago to the New Japan of the present volume the author says: “As
  for me, when I see these things I feel like Rip Van Winkle. I have
  been asleep and centuries have passed over my head.” The record deals
  principally with the chief object of the expedition which was that of
  carrying the insignia of a Knight of the garter to the Emperor of
  Japan. “To live as a youth in feudal Japan and to gather up the lore
  about tycoons, ronins, etc., and of gods, men and things which have
  utterly vanished, and then again in life’s afternoon and as a king’s
  envoy, to enter the same land when panoplied in modern steel and
  machinery, is a rare privilege.” (Ind.)

  “The narrative is one of sustained interest. The circumstances and
  environment are described with the grace and restraint proper to a
  record of what took place on Japanese soil. Lord Redesdale’s hand has
  lost none of its cunning.”

  which is absent from those of most writers on Japan.”

  “Most wonderful of all, and most to be commended to those of our
  readers who have never seen Japan, is the picture which Lord Redesdale
  conjures with singular vividness and convincing force, of a people
  trained to greatness, because trained to the pursuit of great ideals,
  under a code of national ethics unique in the history of the whole
  world, of which the first and last commandment is that where Japan is
  concerned ‘self entirely disappears.’”

  Folly, the frivolous, whose wealth of hair tones with the “coppery
  gold of unfolding peach-buds ... never pretty ... but with the smile
  that would turn the head of the devil himself” furnishes an unusual
  study of the alluring feminine type. The ban of human opinion would
  relegate her to outer darkness for leaving her home and husband and
  placing her love in the keeping of a man to whom she is irresistibly
  drawn, one upon whom disease had passed the death sentence. In spite
  of the inverted moral perspective, Folly works out her own salvation,
  gathers force and courage in her negative struggle and in the end
  rights her stand in a manner to free the reader from the story’s
  depression. Thruout her freakish career she is never deserted by a
  “complaisant, upright and at times stupid” husband, a tender
  sympathetic mother-in-law and a staunch and loyal friend of her school

  Dr. Ries begins his presentation with a study of American coals....
  After coal, petroleum and natural gas are briefly and well-treated,

  This “story of Fifth avenue life” written in the author’s clever vein
  is the unpleasant account of a man satiated with all the joys that
  wealth can buy, who has lost active interest in all things including
  his charming wife and child. A woman of rare beauty comes into his
  home to nurse his little girl, and then developes a most heinous plot
  in which this beautiful viper tries to murder the wife by means of a
  subtle poison, so that she may win the husband and his wealth. In the
  excitement of this discovery and the events which follow, in their
  selfish joy at their re-union and their re-found happiness, they allow
  her to go unchallenged, and discover too late that she has made
  another woman and another home her prey.

  of the great Herr Wolfgang’s symphony orchestra.... Franz, who is
  introduced as a boy violinist, sick with desire to be a real boy
  instead of a musical prodigy, grows up to be a very noble and serious
  sort of a genius. The other boy, who had the passion for the flute,
  also grows up, to play Jonathan to Franz’s David. And there is a girl.
  The girl plays the harp and writes poems, and she is very lovely and
  very good.... The other leading characters are a first violin, who is
  a villain, and the conductor, the famous Herr Wolfgang. The remainder
  of the orchestra is cast for comic parts.”—N. Y. Times.

=Schiaparelli, Giovanni Virginio.= Astronomy in the Old Testament.
*$1.15. Oxford.

  A scientific treatment of the scattered astronomical data of the Old
  Testament by the director of the Brere observatory in Milan. “The
  introduction discusses Israel’s learned men and its so-called
  scientific knowledge; and its general view of the physical world as
  seen in the book of Job. The firmament, the earth, and the abysses are
  sketched in a figure, which seems to represent as nearly as can be
  done, the Hebrew idea of the world. Indeed, it greatly aids the reader
  in understanding many hitherto obscure passages regarding the abyss,
  the depths of sheol, etc. With a master’s skill he treats stars and
  constellations—dependent, however, in many places on the results of
  Hebrew scholars for his word-meanings. The days, months, and the year
  of the Jewish calendar are particularly instructive after his
  discussion. While he recognizes some value in the Babylonian
  astronomical data, he is distinctly conservative in his use of them.”

  exploited by him in his former account of his experiences with the
  Japanese army—the success of the Japanese officials in preventing and
  curing disease. The reasons for this remarkable record are the simple,
  non-irritating food of the Japanese soldier, the obedience to orders
  of the surgeons invariably displayed, and the thorough preparation and
  constant vigilance of those in charge of the health of the army. Major
  Seaman considers this a greater victory than that won on the field of
  battle, and makes an earnest plea for similar measures in the American
  army.”—Critic.

  for the privilege of sharing the glory of the name and placing the

  takes part in a successful engagement with the French and thereby wins
  promotion, tells the story of the beautiful Lady Arabella, ward of his
  uncle Sir Philip Hawkshaw, whom he at first loves and then comes to
  despise. A joy to the eye, Lady Arabella is a menace to the morals. A
  lover of cards and a trifler with men, she throws her heart at the
  feet of a man who will not have it, and all but swears away the life
  of an impetuous youth whose love she has spurned and who tried to
  elope with her, then later, to spite them both, she marries the head
  of their house and thru her first-born succeeds in cutting them both
  off from a fortune. Other characters, however, share the honors with
  Arabella and there is a truly true love story which is not hers.

  “In every life, says the author of this volume, there is some secret
  garden where one ‘unbinds the girdle of conventions and breathes to a
  sympathetic listener opinions one would repudiate on the house tops.’
  Lacking a proper sympathetic soul a diary might serve. Upon this
  theory the book is constructed. It is in the form of a diary, and
  actually consists of a number of short essays on a number of subjects
  such as The modern woman and marriage, The ideal husband, Amateur
  saints, The fourth dimension, The beauty of cruelty, Are American
  parents selfish? The pleasures of pessimism, The value of a soul

=Sedgwick, Anne Douglas.= Shadow of life. †$1.50. Century.

  If indeed it is in the shadow of things that this story pursues its
  way, it is such a shadow as Ruskin attributes to disappointment, the
  Titian twilight in which one sees the “real color of things with
  deeper truth than in the most dazzling sunshine.” Gavin and Eppie are
  two lonely children, hungering for happiness, who during a brief
  summer in a Scottish country home exchange their weird confidences.
  During sixteen years, Gavin is absent, then returns to find Eppie a
  splendid young woman of such strength, sweetness and daring that she
  seemed a “Flying victory” done by Velasquez. The romance that is
  quickened to the point of vows is blighted by temperamental
  differences. Gavin forces Eppie who loved life and battle to see that
  he would suffocate her, that he was the negation of everything that
  she believed in. The tragedy is one of helplessness.

  “The life-story of the brilliant but erratic genius, Oscar Wilde,
  whose sun of promise rose so bright and had so dire a setting, is
  presented to us in a handsome and dignified volume.... Although the
  book is confessedly an apology or defense, and promises at the outset
  to refute many calumnies and to effect noteworthy results in clearing
  from the foul aspersions of malignity a name still dear to hundreds of
  faithful disciples, yet there is fortunately, a wise avoidance of
  unsavory details regarding the events that clouded Wilde’s closing
  years and led to his tragic end.... The volume ... is supplied with a
  good index; while the bibliography, showing a surprising number of
  titles in prose and verse, with translations into French, German,

  the brilliancy of Wilde’s talents as a writer, mingled with regret and

  The scenes of Mr. Sienkiewicz’s latest story are laid in Poland during
  the reign of King John Sobieski, just before the Turkish invasion in
  1682 to 1683. It concerns the romance of Panna Anulka and Pan Yotsek,
  an impecunious scion of a noble house. The guardian of the heroine, a
  strong-headed Polish nobleman determines to marry his ward, but dies
  on the eve of their betrothal. The fibre of the story is woven amid
  brawls and duels, lawlessness, riot and drunkenness: yet on the plane
  of this early barbarity are expressed fine notions of honor, loyalty
  and patriotism which are elements in Poland’s spiritual harvest.

  gentleman, he commits the fatal error of marrying a pretty girl who is
  universally regarded as a fool.... She loves her husband with a
  devotion so complete as to blind him and others to its true nature.

  return for her devotion is to desert her, to accuse her of infidelity,
  and to leave her again to die heart-broken while he finds a hero’s

=Sinclair, Upton Beall, jr.= Jungle. †$1.50. Doubleday.

  Chicago in its worst industrial phases is the scene of Mr. Sinclair’s
  story. His hero is a sturdy Lithuanian who, with a little colony of
  fellow countrymen, including the frail Ona whom he would wed, settles
  in the Packingtown district. It is first as a wage-earner—the victim
  of foremen’s immoral practices and of real estate sharks’
  trickery—that Jurgis Rudkus struggles; worsted in his battle, and
  yielding to exhaustion and hopelessness, he becomes a tramp, a common
  thief, a highwayman, a beggar. Temporary respite comes with the
  protection offered by a corrupt political machine whose bosses secure
  him work. He looked out on “a world in which nothing counted but
  brutal might, an order devised by those who possessed it for the
  subjugation of those who did not.” Finally the “saving grace” of
  socialism is balm for his industrial grievances, and here the author
  expatiates upon the salutary virtues of socialism.

=Smith, Francis Hopkinson.= Tides of Barnegat. †$1.50. Harper.

  A strange commingling of irresponsibility and duty operates in Mr.
  Smith’s new story with its artistic and dramatic touches. The loyal,
  fine-spirited Jane Cobden gives up her doctor and with him her hope of
  happiness to guard her will o’ the wisp sister’s sin and to mother the
  child born out of wedlock. The sacrifice becomes a thing of splendid
  heroism, and furnishes the motif of a story which reflects in its
  characters the sturdy traits of shore folk, and in its out-of-door
  atmosphere the freshness and varying moods of the sea.

  whom he defends is beyond question but his hypnotic oratory secures

  debasement at having sacrificed right to personal ambition makes him
  an easy prey to the woman’s wiles. He kills her in self defense, and
  sets fire to his garret to cover the deed. His composed confession is
  passed by for a “gruesome pleasantry,” and the reader is confident

  history of the guild has never been compiled. The present work is put
  forth, perhaps rather tentatively than exhaustively, to supply the
  omissions.” Beginning with chapters on Florentine commerce and
  industry, and, General history of the guilds, the guilds themselves
  are taken up under the sub-divisions of, The seven greater guilds, The
  five intermediate guilds, and The nine minor guilds, after which the
  life and work in the markets, the religion of the guilds, their
  patronage and their charity, are fully discussed. A bibliography,

  slain, offers himself to her in marriage and is accepted. They have

  shadow of guilt that separates him from Ulrich. The latter, wholly

  stubborn fact that his wife had been made a widow by the deed of his

  This book, which won the Nobel peace prize for 1905, is a powerful
  plea for universal disarmament. It is the autobiography of an Austrian
  countess born with true martial spirit, her only grief that she cannot
  win laurels on the field of battle. At seventeen she marries a dashing
  young lieutenant and one short year later, clasping her fatherless son
  to her heart she awakens to the real horrors of war. Her hatred of war
  and warfare is justified by the story of the thirty years that follow.
  She draws pictures of agony, disease and mutilation as seen in 1864,
  1866, and again when she lost the love of her mature years at Paris,
  and she shows between these periods such happy years of peace that the
  reader shudders with her at the contrast.

  A third and illustrated edition of this life of Voltaire, the man of
  strong and varied emotions. “His life was a long conflict ... but when
  in old age he had become the acknowledged leader of European thought
  ... he was born with a genius for friendship; he was a man of heart
  and of feeling.... He took a low, some might say true, view of human
  nature, but he constantly sought to relieve miseries of humanity....
  The attack upon oppression was the true work of his life. In this he
  was absolutely sincere. He told lie after lie, but he never descended
  to that most insiduous form of falsehood under which a man forsakes
  his own convictions.... He never deserted the cause to which he was
  devoted.” (Nation.)

  In his arraignment of society in general and certain phases of human
  nature in particular, the author takes his reader over the ground of
  an old question—the Roman Catholic denial of divorce. “The
  noble-hearted Irish girl of the story is most cruelly confronted with
  the fact that unless she would lose what is to her the only hope of
  heaven, she may not put away finally and by divorce her drunken,
  brutal, and bestial husband, and in plain fact may hold more hope of
  final salvation in a life of sin than in a marriage of the truest
  affection following a divorce.” (Outlook.)

conversations kept by Horace Traubel. **$3. Small.

  The author, an Englishman, makes no claim to biographical
  completeness, but simply gives daily jottings on talks with Whitman
  extending over a period of four months together with many letters of
  the period. “One may hazard a prophecy that the unbeliever will be a
  convert before he closes its pages; not from any propaganda on the
  poet’s part, but from the sheer human affection which his
  companionship inspires.” (N. Y. Times.)

  A spell of mystery is cast over Mr. Vachell’s new story in which a
  young English-Breton girl and a Cornish artist play the leading rôles.
  “Falsely they both play because the two troublesome strings of their
  instruments, love and ambition refuse to get into tune. The resulting
  discords seem to Tephany to be due to a certain face of clay, the
  death mask of a beautiful model her lover, Michael, has once painted,
  and she resolves to destroy it. Her hand, however is mysteriously
  stayed.... The message of the mask accomplishes itself, the avenging
  Furic finds his due, the apparition of the aukon is driven away, and

=Van Vorst, Marie.= Miss Desmond: an impression. †$1.50. Macmillan.

  It was Balzac who created the heroine of thirty, and Marie Van Vorst
  has perpetuated the creation in her present fiction study. Miss
  Desmond is of the Puritan type, and after burying thirty-two years in
  her shut-away New England garden, finds herself unexpectedly expanding
  under the influence of the new life at a Swiss resort while
  chaperoning the daughter of her handsome and much talked-of sister.
  The threads of the story begin to tangle when the increasingly radiant
  Miss Desmond becomes her sister’s rival, and yields to the enchantment
  in spite of the fact that Robert Bedford has not an unblemished
  reputation.

**$5. Harper.

  At the time of General Lew Wallace’s death his autobiography was
  practically complete. It is written with the personal note
  individualizing and vitalizing a career which tho it began in
  uneventful commonplaces grew to distinction in letters, politics, war
  and diplomacy. A certain simplicity of life and creed pervades the
  sketch and a magnificent sense of justice. Wallace’s boyhood and
  youth, in which are set forth the struggles to find himself, his young
  manhood, full of patriotism and his maturity in which the lawyer and

  Mrs. Ward’s latest novel is based upon the story of the painter George
  Romney, whose thirty years’ separation from his wife for the sake of
  his art is reduced to twelve in the present story. The hero, John
  Fenwick, from the Westmorland hills, possesses a great uncouth,
  untrained genius for painting which longs for expression. In
  satisfying his ambition to go to London he subordinates wife, child,
  all heart things to his one great art passion. Out of his hesitation
  to admit the existence of a wife to his uncertain London friends and
  patrons grows an estrangement which is unconsciously aided by Eugenie
  de Pastourelles, the Eleanor of the story, a woman of great strength,
  but unfortunate in her marriage. As Mrs. Ward’s art demands the
  shifting of moral and ethical values to the right focus, with sure
  steady touch she extricates and arrays in order the confused forces.

  the birth of another baby, brings his new family back to Japan to
  unite it with his old family. The difficulties are easily seen but all
  are surmounted. The eldest son has rebelled against his new mother and
  joined the Japanese army, the father follows him, wins glory in the

  possibility, which the united action of God and the people may make a
  reality. He tells of a fashionable church which was mysteriously
  transplanted in a single night and set up stone on stone among the
  poor of Water street. He depicts most vividly the scorn with which the
  fashionable members of the old church regard the poor with whom they
  are thus brought in contact, and he shows the great good which came of
  it all. It is a story so true to human nature that it makes one pause
  to think. The author’s character drawing is excellent and he has
  softened his moral by introducing into his parable the love story of
  the young minister and Irene, the flower of his flock.

=Wells, Herbert George.= In the days of the comet. †$1.50. Century.

  A young middle-class Englishman loves a girl who elopes with the son
  of a landed proprietor. The outraged suitor pursues the couple, bent
  upon murder and suicide. Then the comet intervenes. It strikes the
  earth and diffuses a trance-producing vapor. When the world wakens
  there are no longer passions and rivalries. At this point the author
  works out a state of socialistic reform characterized by brotherhood
  principles. The hero finds love an impersonal thing with none of the
  old proprietary limitations. Woman to him becomes the “shape and color
  of the divine principle that lights the world,” and whether wife or
  friend he may love her without reproach.

  London and its awful problems of labor and poverty is the theme of
  this bitterly real study of “the other half,” thru which there ever
  runs a note of hope. Prue at twenty, penniless, unskilled, tho gently
  born and bred, casts herself into the maelstrom of London in a pitiful
  attempt to earn a living, and there realizes her own helplessness and
  all but goes down before the overwhelming fear of it, clinging for
  comfort to the mongrel dog she can ill afford to keep. The people whom
  she meets in the course of her plucky career as an incompetent working
  girl. Sarah the charwoman, Laura, a gem engraver, Leonard the young
  editor of The branding-iron, a journal of the back streets, and all
  the others, interest us not so much as individuals as parts of a

  All were taken from Rome to France as children and made brilliant

  romantic careers. Had not Mazarin been so obstinate, Marie Mancini
  would have been consort of Louis XIV. of France. Olympe became the
  Comtesse de Soissons; Marianne, Duchesse de Bouillon, who was
  implicated in the poison trials of 1680; Hortense the Duchesse de
  Mazarin, fled from her jealous, bigoted husband, and became a reigning

=Winter, Alice Ames.= Jewel weed. †$1.50. Bobbs.

  In the foreground of this story with a middle west setting is a
  quartette of young people composed of Dick Percival of substantial
  family connections, his college friend Ellery Norris who is striving
  to make good his heralded efficiency, Madeline Elton, a finely bred
  young woman, and Lena Quincy whose gilded vulgarity finds fit
  expression in the jewel weed. The “jewel weed” becomes Dick’s protege,
  later his wife, and as such a foreign element in the refined
  atmosphere of his mother’s home. In contrast to her selfishness which
  menaces her husband’s social, financial and political career is the
  fine loyalty of Madeline, which champions everybody’s cause—Ellery
  Norris more than all others.

=Wister, Owen.= Lady Baltimore. †$1.50. Macmillan.

  This story might be called the “Love affairs of a bachelor” in the
  objective sense of Lilian Bell’s “Love affairs of an old maid.” For
  the hero finds real life and other people’s matrimonial projects more
  fascinating than musty genealogical records that sufficiently searched
  will prove the blood of kings in his veins and admit him to the
  “Selected salic scions.” The setting is typically Southern and among
  the characters are a charming dispenser of cakes at a Woman’s
  exchange, a young man whose approaching marriage to a brilliant siren
  furnishes cause for a vast expenditure of the hero’s quixotic
  chivalry, and numerous old ladies of King’s Port. It would divulge too
  much of the whimsically clever story to reveal the meaning of so high
  sounding a title as “Lady Baltimore.”

  A scientific inquiry into the characteristics of royalty based upon a
  large and well chosen bibliography to which detailed references are
  given. The study of 832 characters forms the main body of the work,
  altho 3,312 distinct persons are mentioned. The members of the ruling
  families of England, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Spain,
  Portugal, Austria, Italy, Russia, Denmark, and Sweden are considered,
  each individual being graded mentally and morally according to a
  standard of 1 to 10, the period covered extending in general back to

  the mental and moral status of royalty as compared with the world in
  general, and to throw light upon the old question of relative
  importance of environment and heredity. 104 portraits illustrate the

=Wyllie, William Lionel.= J. M. W. Turner. $3. Macmillan.

  “This volume is illustrated in tint and color, with reproductions of
  most of Turner’s well-known paintings. The author has tried, he says,
  to look at Turner’s life and work from a non-literary point of view,
  ‘as they appear to a fellow-painter traveling, however remotely, along
  the same road.’”—R. of Rs.

  interesting and informing on every page.”

  “Mr. Wyllie’s style is somewhat crude, and there may be even an

  the course of Turner’s artistic development.”

  spot,’ and it is no injustice to say that it smells very little of the
  lamp. There is, of course, a considerable historical spice. After all
  the pictures are the thing.”

=Young, Alexander Bell Filson.= Sands of pleasure. †$1.50. Estes.

  A young engineer is the hero of this tale, busy in the first part with
  constructing a light house on the Cornish coast. The scene shifts to
  Paris when the reaction after work is of the pleasure seeking sort and
  deadly. The third part of the book presents the hero back from the
  scene of infatuations hard at work, effacing stains and memories.

  others.”

  “Mr. Filson Young has a better sense of style than sense of life. His
  work bears the hallmark of youth and inexperience.”

      – =Ath.= 1905, 2: 794. D. 9. 330w.

  “A book that from first to last is stamped by a rare sanity and subtle
  wisdom. The scene of their dramatic parting and its petty, sordid
  cause is ... one of those little miracles of intuition which are the
  hallmarks of genius.” Frederic Taber Cooper.

  “In our opinion, his book—lacking any moral idea or the forcible
  enunciation of any moral idea—is by no means suitable for mixed
  reading, and should be kept strictly to adults.”

  “All through the book there is somehow a sense of strain, of tension,
  as if the author were trying to materialise some inspiration that kept
  ever evading him. Some of the descriptions are excellent and the book
  abounds in happy phrases. But the final impression is disappointment.”

  Here is a picture of Washington projected on a screen, with the
  city,—its ideals, its types, and its institutions,—as a background.
  Well to the fore are the intrigues, political and social, which are
  intended to prevent the Honorable Arthur Montresor from securing a
  charming American wife whose “character had that froufrou which is
  inevitable with gay vivacity or fashion, but about which there was
  nothing tawdry—it was as graceful and refined as some exquisite lace.”

  A three part story book whose tales are founded upon legends and
  fables of Rome as related by Virgil. Part I. gives the story of Aeneas
  and his comrades from the fall of Troy to the founding of Lavinium;
  part II. carries the date thru the early years of Rome to the period
  when fable is merged in history; part III. consists of a group of
  stories partly Italian in origin, partly Greek, yet “essentially are

=Zueblin, Charles.= Decade of civic development. *$1.25. Univ. of
Chicago press.

  A sketch of the “civic renascence” in America “is not merely a
  chronicle of civic development for the last decade. Its tone is
  hortatory and also prophetic.” (School R.) Under the following chapter
  headings, there is material for teachers to use in awakening the
  “civic consciousness” in pupils: The new civic spirit, The training of
  the citizen, The making of the city, “The White city” and after,

  unusual value.” E. G. Routzahn.

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
